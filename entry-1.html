     <h1>I Love Collecting!</h1>
      <p>Hello, my name is James and I have a crippling addiction to collecting all sorts of popular media. 
      Because of my tiny, feeble monkey brain, I cant pass up anything fun and shiny, especially if its vintage!
      Im always getting new stuff every week so I thought Id start this page to document my most recent pickups.
      Hope you enjoy browsing my collection :)

   <h2>What I collected this week (9/11/22):</h2>
   <ul>
      <li>Slug Lamp</li>
      <li>Bunny? Night Light</li>
   </ul>
    <p> </p>
    <p>- Lately ive been on a quest for unique forms of lighting. I think the right mixture of lamps and such
      can really help set the ambience in a room. These little guys were there perfect pickup.
